## Hydrology science cluster meeting  25-27 November 2024
*Published: 18.12.2024*

EarthCODE team has started engagement with key project's stakeholders. Recent **Hydrology Science Cluster Meeting** held at ESA/ESRIN in Frascati, created an opportunity to introduce ESA Open Science Initiatives to several ESA and EC-funded projects participated in the workshop. This meeting provided a unique opportunity to present, project's latest research, discuss challenges, and explore synergies.  

During one-hour dedicated session **EarthCODE team (Anca Anghalea, ESA; Silvester Pari, EOX; Tejas Morbagal harish and Gunnar Brandt from Brockmann Consult and Dean Summer, Lampada)** demonstrated the latest improvements and future capabilities that will be implemented to create an advanced open science environment for Earth Science researchers and EO data scientists to efficiently work on research projects. Through the EarthCODE Portal, scientists can access cloud platforms, manage workflows, and share results, enhancing discoverability and reuse within the research community.  

Project managers, gathered in the meeting, had an opportunity to see how data sharing and their publication will become easier, but also how this will facilitate data search and re-usability of the products.  

Real use case examples of how the platform is being used by the projects (e.g. **[Hydrology datacube in DeepESDL](https://deepesdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/hydrology-1D-0-009deg-100x60x60-3-0-2-zarr/)**) has been demonstrated, showing a potential and addressing the products of Hydrology Science Cluster interest.

## Follow-up
As a follow-up to the meeting, user-survey to dedicated EarthCODE users and early adopters has been launched. One-to-one interviews with the project managers are also in the pipeline at the beginning of the next year (2025). 

The interviews are open to all Earth System Science researchers involved in EO ESA-funded project.
