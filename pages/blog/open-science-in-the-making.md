Open Science is being made live at the “Open Science in the Making” area at LPS 2025!  
Here, scientists and Free Open Source Software developers will come together to:

- Discuss best practices in Open Science  
- Collaborate on user-driven expansions to open source tools and algorithms  
- FAIRify, integrate, and share applications and data  
- Brainstorm on the most impactful Open Source projects supporting EO research  

**📍 Location:** [Foyer L3 (Level 1)](https://lps25.esa.int/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/open-science-02.jpg)

### Meet the Experts:
