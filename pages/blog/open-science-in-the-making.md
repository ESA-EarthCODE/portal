Open Science is being made live at the ‚ÄúOpen Science in the Making‚Äù area at LPS 2025!  
Here, scientists and Free Open Source Software developers will come together to:

- Discuss best practices in Open Science  
- Collaborate on user-driven expansions to open source tools and algorithms  
- FAIRify, integrate, and share applications and data  
- Brainstorm on the most impactful Open Source projects supporting EO research  

**üìç Location:** Foyer L2 (Level 1)

### Meet the Experts:
- **ESA‚Äôs EarthCODE**: Open Science and FAIR practitioners. [Register for 1:1 session to bring your data to EarthCODE. Limited Spots available](https://forms.office.com/e/Rzh5TTU1uh).
- **OGC Open Science Persistent Demonstrator**: Experts in reproducibility and Earth Science tech.
- **ESA APEx project**: Specialists in scaling scientific algorithms into products and services. [‚ÄúRegister for APEx / OpenEO / STAC one-to-one session‚Äù](mailto:apex@esa.int?subject=Register%20to%201-to-1%20session%20at%20LPS)
- **OSGeo & EOEPCA developers**: Free and Open Source Software contributors.
- **Communities**: Pangeo, FORGE, SEN4CAP, EO-TDL and more.
