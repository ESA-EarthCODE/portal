### EarthCODE is set to take the stage at FOSS4G 2025 with an interactive workshop! 

## EarthCODE Workshop at FOSS4G 2025 14th/15th of July 2025
*Published: 10/03/2025*

The workshop will guide participants through the full work-cycle on EarthCODE, from accessing Earth Observation (EO) datasets to publishing experiments for the wider scientific community. 

During this hands-on session, attendees will explore EarthCODE’s capabilities, including seamless data discovery, integration with platforms like Euro Data Cube and Pangeo, and best practices for reproducibility in EO research. Practical exercises will cover open data best practices, scalable data analysis for EO, and FAIR-compliant experiment publication. By engaging with real-world EO data, participants will gain valuable insights into leveraging EarthCODE for their own scientific endeavors. 

The workshop will conclude with an open discussion, inviting participants to provide feedback on EarthCODE’s development and explore ways to enhance community-driven collaboration. As Open Science continues to shape the future of Earth Observation, EarthCODE is fostering a more transparent, accessible, and innovative research landscape. Join us at FOSS4G 2025!
