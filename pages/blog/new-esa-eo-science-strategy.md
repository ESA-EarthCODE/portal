## New ESA EO Science Strategy
*Published: 20/12/2024*

In October 2024 ESA EO published its renewed “Earth Science in Action for Tomorrow’s World” Science Strategy. The document outlines a vision for ESA Earth science through 2040, presenting priorities and accompanying approaches that both reflect the need for discovery science, as well as the ability to respond to specific scientific and societal challenges. It identifies the areas of science that ESA needs to respond to, along the full value chain – from the development of innovative Earth Observation missions through to excellent Earth science and uptake of new observations by the user and applications community. 

At the heart of the Earth Observation Science Strategy, overarching science themes and guiding questions are identified. These encapsulate critical Earth system science issues and knowledge gaps in which Earth observation satellite technology provides a unique contribution, either leveraging existing or near-future data sources or by developing new capabilities and filling observation gaps. 

Open Science and Open Innovation are highlited in the new ESA Science Strategy as key enablers for Earth Action, transversally across these various science themes.

## Strategic Objectives

Three strategic objectives were formulated to foster FAIR Open Science and Open Innovation: 

- To foster the development of a culture and practice of openness in EO science, applications and industry, and of a sustainable open innovation ecosystem 
- To develop and enhance European capabilities for harnessing digital innovation, such as AI, to maximise the exploitation of EO data for scientific and socio-economic benefits 
- To facilitate cross-disciplinarity, cooperation and engagement of complementary communities and their expertise into the EO scientific and innovation process 

 

EarthCODE contributes directly to the achievement of these objectives.
