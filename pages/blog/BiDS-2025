### Supporting the Big Data Foundations for EO Course

In the week preceding the conference, EarthCODE contributed to the Big Data Foundations for Earth Observation training course, providing two hands-on practical sessions delivered by [Anne Fouilloux](https://annefou.github.io/):

* FAIR Data & Open Science ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW0yHRjkX04&list=PLvT7fd9OiI9Xq5_UBdD2aVYK9qbObINpz&index=5))
* EO Processing Workflows / Python for EO ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1esltmOVwZU&list=PLvT7fd9OiI9Xq5_UBdD2aVYK9qbObINpz&index=6))

These sessions equipped participants with essential skills for working with modern EO data ecosystems. The full agenda and training materials are available on the ESA EO for Society Website.

### A Practical EarthCODE Workshop at BiDS 2025

At the conference itself, EarthCODE hosted a dedicated workshop focusing on practical, end-to-end workflows, demonstrating how to develop and execute interoperable EO analyses using standard interfaces, cloud-ready data formats, and reproducible coding practices.
All workshop notebooks, slides, and examples are openly available.

Through these activities, EarthCODE continued to advance its mission: empowering the EO community with open tools, shared knowledge, and a collaborative environment to build the next generation of science and applications.
