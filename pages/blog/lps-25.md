## Open Science at the Living Planet Symposium 2025
*Published: 14/05/2025*

**Dates:** 23–27 June 2025  
**Location:** Vienna, Austria  
**LPS 2025 Website:** [lps25.esa.int](https://lps25.esa.int/)

The Living Planet Symposium 2025, hosted by the European Space Agency in Vienna, brings together the global Earth observation community to explore how satellite data can support science, policy, and innovation. **Open Science and Digital Innovation** is one of the key thematics of the event. Under this theme, the programme offers Agoras, Tehcnical Sessions, Side Events and conversations suitable for both Earth scientists and technology enthusiasts. 

Here are the most relevant sessions to follow:

## 🌐 23-27 June | 📍 Foyer | OPEN SCIENCE IN THE MAKING

 An innovative format where developers and scientists meet to work together on making data and workflows FAIR.
  **Book your 1:1 session with a developer, bring your dataset and publish it on-the-spot to EarthCODE! Cool prizes for the champions of reproducibility!**

[Register your project and book a session.](https://forms.office.com/e/Rzh5TTU1uh)

Spots are limited and will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. We recommend booking early to secure your slot. If you have questions or need any clarifications, leave a comment on the EarthCODE Discourse Forum [topic for the event](https://discourse-earthcode.eox.at/t/publish-your-project-s-data-at-lps-2025/80)
