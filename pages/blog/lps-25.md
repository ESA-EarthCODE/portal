## EarthCODE at ESA LPS 2025
*Published: 20/12/2024*

Held every three years, ESA’s Living Planet Symposia are among the world’s premier events on Earth observation, attracting a wide community of international scientists and innovators in EO. The 2025 edition is set to be the largest and most innovative one yet.  

With the climate crisis intensifying, the Living Planet Symposium 2025 (LPS25) emphasises transitioning from ‘observation to climate action and sustainability for Earth’. FAIR Open Science and Open Innovation will be at the heart of the event, being key enablers for Earth Action, accelerating discovery and facilitating the transition from Science to Innovation.  

As an implementation of ESA’s vision for Open Science and Innovation in EO, EarthCODE will have a strong presence at LPS 2025, with demos, presentations and community engagement.

## Updates
Stay tuned for updates, as the LPS 2025 Programme evolves.
