## EarthCODE at EUMETSAT25
*Published: 13.09.2025*

At this year’s EUMETSAT Meteorological Satellite Conference in Lyon, we’re excited to introduce EarthCODE to the community.

With the theme “From Space to Safety”, the conference brings together scientists, technologists, and policy makers focused on how satellite data can be used to safeguard people, ecosystems, and infrastructure.

On Monday we’ll present how EarthCODE delivers real-world impact, guiding you through the vibrant Open Science ecosytem, cloud EO platforms and FAIR tools — turning scientific results to reproducible, FAIR & Open science.

🗓 Mon 15 Sept, 13:45 – 14:00
 📍 Gratte ciel 1+2, Centre de Congrès de Lyon
 🎙 Talk: EarthCODE – Advancing Open Science and FAIR practices for EO transparency, collaboration & reuse
