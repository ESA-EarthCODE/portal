## April Agriculture Science Cluster Webinar
*Published: 17.04.2025*

On April 10th, the EarthCODE team hosted a dedicated Webina for ESA's [Agriculture Science Cluster](https://eo4society.esa.int/communities/scientists/esa-agriculture-science-cluster/), to explore solutions for the long-term availability and FAIRness of data generated by the cluster's research projects.

The session brought together researchers and stakeholders to discuss key challenges in data sharing and storage, emphasizing the importance of FAIR principles—making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. A central theme was the role of EarthCODE in addressing these challenges by streamlining data discovery, publication, and reuse.

## Presentation Topics

- **Using EarthCODE for research workflows** across multiple platforms, including data sharing even in early project stages  
- **Tools available via the EarthCODE portal**, designed to simplify research tasks  
- **Engaging with the EarthCODE community** and getting the most out of collaborative tools  

Attendees were also invited to **share feedback** and raise questions during an open discussion with the EarthCODE team.

## Join the Conversation

We invite you to join the EarthCODE Forum, hosted on Discourse, to continue the conversation. 

We’ve created a dedicated community space for the **Agriculture Science Cluster** [here](https://discourse-earthcode.eox.at/t/agriculture-cluster-webinar-discussion-and-q-a/65), where you can contribute further questions, connect with peers, and follow up with the EarthCODE team. 

Feel free to reach out via this channel!
