# EarthCODE's Ecosystem

<p><img src="/img/EarthCODE_Ecosystem.png" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 2rem 2rem"/>The EarthCode ecosystem integrates tools, platforms and communities to support FAIR science for EarthAction. The four pillars of EarthCode are the Open Science Catalog, the ESA project Results repository, the EarthCODE integrated platforms and the EarthCode Community.
<br />
<br />
EarthCODE is closely linked with its sister initiative, APEx, which focuses on taking scientific results to a higher Technology Readiness Level.
