# EarthCODE's Ecosystem

<p><img src="/img/EarthCODE_Ecosystem.png" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 2rem 2rem"/>The EarthCODE ecosystem integrates tools, platforms, and communities to support FAIR Science for EarthAction. The four pillars of EarthCODE are the Open Science Catalog, the ESA Project Results Repository, the EarthCODE integrated platforms and the EarthCODE Community.
<br />
<br />
EarthCODE is closely linked with its sister initiative, APEx, which focuses on taking scientific results to a higher Technology Readiness Level.

## ESA Project Results Repository (PRR)

The ESA Project Results Repository (PRR) provides long term storage of research outcomes from ESA-funded EO Projects and activities. It provides a harmonised and structured way to store research outcomes (including data, workflows, experiment, and associated documentation). Research outcomes are organised in STAC Objects (Collections), accessible via the STAC API and the Open Science Catalog Browser.

<a href="https://esa-earthcode.github.io/tutorials/index-1/">Publication of results to the PRR</a> is highly encouraged for projects aiming to ensure long-term research outcomes preservation, accessibility and amplified the scientific impact of the project.
