## Our Mission, Vision and Goals

### Mission statement: 
 
Our mission is to develop an open-source solution that empowers scientists to adopt FAIR and Open Science principles, whether conducting research on cloud environments accessible via the EarthCODE Portal or their own infrastructure. To maximise the discovery and reuse of FAIR scientific data, workflows, and documentation, we develop EarthCODE as a hub for research management, dissemination, community engagement, and learning. 


### Vision statement: 
To accelerate scientific discovery and support Earth Action by making Earth science data and methods FAIR, Open, and reproducible. Leveraging cutting-edge cloud computing technologies, AI, and open-source solutions, we empower collaboration and innovation for a sustainable future. 


### Goals overview:
EarthCODE is designed to deliver a user-centric, advanced open science environment tailored to the needs of EO scientists. By focusing on usability and engagement, EarthCODE ensures researchers can efficiently conduct FAIR, reproducible, and sustainable Earth Science research within the ESRIN Science Hub and ESA Science Clusters.
