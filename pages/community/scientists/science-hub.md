# ESA Science Hub
The Earth System Science Hub is an ESA facility designed to promote and support advanced Earth System and climate science studies. Science Hub is a centre of excellence for scientific collaboration and networking but also ideas exchange on the major science challenges of this decade. Science Hub activities are led by a dynamic and diverse group of international scientists, who bring their domain-specific expertise to closer look at some major challenges, underlying processes and drivers affecting our planet. All these activities are done in a cutting-edge, collaborative, cloud computing and open science environment to unlock the full potential of latest EO technologies.

## How EarthCODE supports ESA Science Hub Researchers

<a href="https://sciencehub.esa.int/" target="_blank"><img src="/img/ESA_ScienceHub.png" /></a>

Science Hub researchers address a [wide range of topics](https://sciencehub.esa.int/projects/) in Earth System Science, from observing storms to measuring the resilience of forests or understanding extreme events. They carry out cutting edge research leveraging ESA Earth Observation data, aiming to better understand our planet, often in collaboration with the Science Clusters. EarthCODE supports Science Hub researchers in several ways: by providing them with access to powerful computing, helping them publish their results and even offeing training to enhance their knowledge of workign with EO data in the cloud and applying FAIR principles.
