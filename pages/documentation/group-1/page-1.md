#  10 minutes to EarthCODE

Welcome to 10 Minutes to EarthCODE! This quick-start guide is designed to help you begin working with EarthCODE in just a few minutes. Whether you're new to Earth Science, a researcher, or a developer, EarthCODE provides a collaborative, open development environment for efficient access to Earth observation data, workflows, and computational platforms.

## What is EarthCODE?
EarthCODE stands for "Earth Science Collaborative Open Development Environment". EarthCODE is ESA’s Collaborative Open Development Environment for Earth System Science, designed to advance FAIR Open Science principles across ESA-funded activities and Science Clusters. Serving as a central hub, it integrates tools, data, and services for seamless research development, execution, and publication, while fostering collaboration and enabling long-term preservation and reuse of scientific outputs.

## Accessing EarthCODE
To get started, sign in using your [Github](https://github.com/) account. EarthCODE provides secure authentication for accessing resources across platforms. Once authenticated, you'll have access to all the tools and data you need across EarthCODE’s integrated platforms.

## Choosing a Platform
EarthCODE provides streamlined access to a range of platforms offering Earth Science datasets, tools, and services. With single sign-on via OpenID Connect, users can easily authenticate and explore resources tailored to their research needs. Below is a selection of supported platforms:

- Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE): Access Copernicus data and services.
- Deep Earth System Data Laboratory (DeepESDL): Explore geophysical data and modeling resources.
- OpenEO Platform: Standardised interfaces for processing of Earth observation data. 
- Euro Data Cube: Analyze and store satellite data.
- EoxHub/Colcalc: Process Earth observation data in the cloud.
- EoxHub/Pangeo: Perform high-performance computations on Earth Science data.

Choose the platform that best suits your research objectives.

## Exploring the EarthCODE Science Catalog

After selecting your platform, you can explore the EarthCODE Science Catalog. The catalog includes datasets, workflows, and software that have been published and validated within EarthCODE. It's your gateway to a wide range of resources, whether you're looking for environmental data, code for processing, or reusable workflows.

## Validating and Publishing Data

EarthCODE allows you to validate products and experiments, ensuring they meet reproducibility and scientific standards. If you have an ESA-funded project, you can contribute to the platform by publishing your datasets, software, or experiments, making your work available for the broader community to use.

## Who Can Publish?

Anyone with an ESA-funded project is encouraged to publish in EarthCODE. We especially welcome contributions from those part of the ESA Science Clusters, as collaboration among these projects helps promote sharing and innovation in Earth Science research.
