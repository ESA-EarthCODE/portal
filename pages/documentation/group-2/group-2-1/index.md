# Working With Platforms and Sponsorship

*Note to self: should there be another one to focus just on data?*

All EarthCODE platforms are listed by alphabetical order.

We will mostly link to external documentation but to offer a consistent user experience, we will have the same sub-sections for each platform.

## **What is the ESA Network of Resources (NoR)?**

The **ESA Network of Resources (NoR)** is an initiative by the European Space Agency (ESA) to support researchers, scientists, and organizations in accessing and utilizing Earth observation data and computing platforms. Through NoR, ESA provides sponsorship opportunities to help cover the costs of data access, storage, and processing on participating platforms. This ensures that users can focus on their research without being hindered by financial constraints.

NoR works in collaboration with a wide array of service providers, including data hubs, cloud computing platforms, and analytical services. If you're working on an Earth observation project, NoR sponsorship could significantly reduce your operational costs while enhancing your access to cutting-edge resources.

## **Who Can Apply?**

NoR sponsorship is available for:
- Researchers and scientists conducting projects with a strong focus on **Earth observation data**.
- Educational initiatives and institutions integrating Earth observation data into their curriculum.
- Projects aligning with ESA’s objectives, particularly those promoting **sustainable development**, **innovation**, or **technological advancement**.

Applications are assessed based on scientific merit, societal impact, and the alignment with ESA’s mission.
