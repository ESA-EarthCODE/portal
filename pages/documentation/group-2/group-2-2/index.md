# Publishing to the Open Science Catalog (EarthCODE Catalog)

## **Welcome to the Open Science Data Catalogue!**

Open Science Catalog is a web-based application that can be accessed from any Internet browser, by navigating to the website: [https://opensciencedata.esa.int/](https://opensciencedata.esa.int/).

Once inside, you should see the welcome page consisting of the content section, with a short introduction to the catalogue and its functionalities. Discover Projects and Products by browsing through 6 specific thematic research domains!

From the landing page you can also check Search, Catalog, Metrics and API capabilities of the portal!

## Introduction
This document describes and explains the functionality of the web-based interface that contributes to ESA EO Open Science framework: **Open Science Data Catalogue**. Proposed catalog is a publicly available platform that stores geoscience products, datasets and resources developed in the frame of scientific research projects funded by ESA EO (Earth Observation). Products vary in geographical and temporal extent, production methodology, validation, and quality.

The majority of pages on _https://opensciencedata.esa.int_ only hold metadata for each Product and Project. The actual data and its documentation are maintained and accessible by the data providers, outside of esa.int, for the majority of cases. This catalogue provides the metadata and links to the data as it exists in those many other locations.

Open Science Data Catalogue is free to use by any user with an access to Internet. Contributing to catalogue (ingesting new products or updating existing) is reserved to authorized users only (project PIs, data owners).

**What are the capabilities of the Open Science Data Catalogue?**

Open Science Catalog is not only a project's metadata browser. It brings new functionalities and makes them available to scientific community of users, such as:

- Discovery and access for geospatial products + documentation (or/and code)

- Unified metadata across heterogeneous sources
- Common dictionary
- Open to community curation & contribution
- Synoptic view for EO gap analysis

This User Guide is meant to provide explanation of the catalogue's functionalities from starting the catalog, explaining registration and login process through searching for information in the catalogue to data ingestion and user's contribution.
