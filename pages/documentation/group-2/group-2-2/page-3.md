# Metrics and Statistics About the EarthCODE Catalog

## **Metrics**

Open Science Catalog provides and stores also metrics and statistics on records available for users to explore. The OSC Metrics Page provides an overview of the available geospatial products, aggregated by one of selected elements: Variables (default), Themes, Projects, EO Missions. Temporal and spatial coverage of products aggregated under selected category (element) is displayed.

The slider below the metrics window:

allows zoom in and out the display of table containing the metrics.

Products can also be filtered out using a Filter box above the metrics table. The Filter works in the same way as Search, meaning that the product list can be narrowed down by filtering by free typing or by selecting given type of content (by selecting particular Theme, Variable, Project, Product, EO Mission, Geometry: by area of interest indicated on the interactive map or Free text filter).

Once selected, filter name and selected value appears in the text box to facilitate the user removal of selected filter and remembering of different filters applied.

The filter takes also free text as an input, so any word typed in the filter field will be taken to search through the variable names but also their acronyms, product names and description field. Therefore, it is also possible to use keywords if the exact variable or product name of an item is not known. For example, the term _"carbon"_ will return the list of following variables and products _(Carbon Flux, Carbonate, Microphytoplankton Carbon etc.)_.

The last column in that page provides details about spatial coverage of selected product. Click on the globe icon to display the list of products and access their spatial footprint.

To highlight the spatial coverage of selected product select the pin

## **Statistics**

Within the metrics functionality, the_ **"Statistics"** _button is available to summary of the content available within the catalog.User can summarize the products by chosen elements: Variables (default), Themes, Projects, EO Mission.

Click on the **Statistics** button to see the pop-up window divided in three sections:

- Bar chart: representing number of products per year (summary of temporal coverage of products). By navigating over selected bar that represents single year, the description on how many products are available in each year is displayed (as shown below).

- Pie chart: representing number of products that belong to each variable and percentage in a total sum of variables available in the catalog.

- Multicolor pie-chart â€“ representing the distribution of satellite missions used to generate products.
