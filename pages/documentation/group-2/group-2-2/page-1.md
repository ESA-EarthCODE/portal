# Glossary

Adhering by design to the "FAIR" (findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible/reusable) principles, the Open Science Data Catalogue aims to support better knowledge discovery and innovation. It facilitates data and knowledge integration and reuse by the scientific community. With common dictionary and unified metadata across heterogeneous sources, products discovery is facilitated. Published Products are associated to Project and additional information is provided by tags. Themes and variables are used as tag to facilitate products discovery. Earth Observation Satellite Missions used to generate the product is provided by EO-Mission description in Product's metadata.

**THEMES**: one of the Earth Science topics linked to the grand science challenges set in the ESA strategy.

**PROJECT**: scientific research projects funded by ESA EO​

**PRODUCT**: a geoscience product representing the measured or inferred/estimated values of one or more variables over a given time range and spatial area. Products can be distinguished by geographical and temporal extent, production methodology, validation, quality and EO Mission/sensor used to produce them.​

**VARIABLES**: geoscience, climate and environmental variable. Variables are represented in the hierarchical set of Earth Science variables based on GCMD Keywords convention.

**KEYWORDS**:  Keywords are used to facilitate products discovery. Based on hierarchical relationships adopted from NASA GCMD keywords database, keywords usually refer to broader term regarding the variable and are assigned to a given product.

**EO MISSION**: Earth Observation Satellite Missions used to generate the product.
