# EarthCODE Discourse Basics
## Basic Terms Used by Discourse

Here are some key terms you should be familiar with while using Discourse:

- **Topic**: A series of messages grouped together in a meaningful conversation with a title, listed in a category, beginning with an Original Post, and including all replies in chronological order. This is similar to what other platforms might call a "thread."
- **Post**: An individual message within a topic. Each post can be authored by different users, moved to another topic, or become the start of a new topic.
- **Original Post (OP)**: The first post in any topic. It determines the focus of the topic and is associated with the title and tags.
- **Category**: The primary way of organizing topics. Each topic resides in one category, which can have its own permissions and notification settings. Categories are similar to forums on other sites.
- **Tag**: A marker used to describe a topic. Each topic can have multiple tags and users can create new ones.
- **User**: All site activities, like creating posts and recording actions, are centered around registered users. Discourse sites may be private or public, but registration is required for participation.

## EarthCODE Login
EarthCODE Discourse provides a seamless login experience by using the same credentials you already use (Github account) for the EarthCODE platform. When you log in, you'll be redirected to a central login page where you can sign in with your GitHub account. If you're already logged in to Discourse, the forum will recognize your session, so you won't need to log in again. This ensures easy access and a consistent user experience across all EarthCODE services.

## Topic Lists

By default, the Discourse homepage shows all **Latest** conversations, but you can filter this list in several ways:

- **By tag**: Click the 'all tags' title to see a list of all tags.
- **By activity level**: Click 'Top' to list topics by activity level for a specific time period.
- **By new topics**: New topics (created in the last 2 days that you haven’t opened) are marked with a small blue dot:

- **By unread topics**: Topics that you've opened and read for at least 4 minutes but have new posts (replies) are marked with a number in a blue circle:
  ![discourse-topic-unread-indicator](./discourse_basics/discourse-topic-unread-indicator.png)

## See Who's Participating

On the homepage, you can see avatars of:

![participants](./discourse_basics/participants.jpeg) 

- The user who started the topic
- The most active participants
- The user who created the most recent post
- If the original poster is also the most recent poster, the first photo has a blue border or halo:

Indicators at the bottom of the OP show who created the post, the count of replies, and views, and the avatars of the most frequent participants:

# Reading Topics

## Keep Scrolling

Click on a topic title to read replies in chronological order. Use your mouse or the timeline scroll bar on the right to navigate through the conversation. On smaller screens, select the bottom progress bar to expand it.

## Jump Back In

Selecting a topic title takes you to your **last read post**. To enter at the top or bottom, click the reply count or last reply date:
![discourse-topic-list-select-areas](./discourse_basics/discourse-topic-list-select-areas.png)

- Topics above the light red line are new or updated since your last visit.
- Fully read topics have light grey titles:

## Related Topics

Posts can be moved to more appropriate topics, or two related topics can be merged. A link will appear allowing readers to jump to the new location. Related topics are listed at the end of the OP:

![split-topic](./discourse_basics/split-topic.png)
![related-topics](./discourse_basics/related-topics.png)
