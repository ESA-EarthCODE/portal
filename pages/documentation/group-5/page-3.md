# Finding and Posting Content on the EarthCODE Discourse

Finding content on the **EarthCODE Discourse forum** is key to making the most of the platform and avoiding duplication of the same questions. Before posting about a topic, follow these three steps:

## 1. Use the EarthCODE Catalog

Start by browsing the **EarthCODE Catalog**, where discussions are linked to specific items like datasets, workflows, or experiments. Look for the **"Discuss This"** option to:

- Join an existing discussion if one exists.
- Create a new discussion tied to the catalog item.

This keeps discussions directly connected to resources and well-organized.

## 2. Search by Metadata and Tags

On the forum, you can refine your search using **tags**, which are often pre-applied based on metadata from catalog items. Tags make it easy to filter discussions by specific topics or areas of interest.

## 3. Search for Topics

For broader information, use the **search bar** on Discourse to enter keywords or phrases. Apply filters like **categories** or **dates** to quickly locate relevant discussions.

These tools help you find content effectively, whether through the catalog or directly on the forum.

### Replying

![collapse-expand-editor](./jointheconversation/collapse-expand-editor.gif)

- Replies to a specific post are linked to that post:
  - If your reply is next in chronological order, it appears next.
  - If not, your post has a link to the previous post for context, and the original post shows a count of replies.

# Starting New Topics and Discussions

Posting on the **EarthCODE Discourse forum** is straightforward, but following a few best practices ensures discussions remain relevant and organized.

## Unsure If Your Topic Is Worth Posting? Post It!
If you're uncertain whether your question or topic warrants a discussion, post it. Others might have the same question or interest but haven’t raised it yet. Your contribution could benefit the community.

## Reply Before Starting a New Topic
Whenever possible, **respond to an existing discussion** rather than starting a new one. This consolidates information and avoids fragmenting conversations. Use the **search function** or **tags** to locate relevant topics before posting.

## Starting a Discussion About an Item in the EarthCODE Catalog
If your discussion relates to an item in the **EarthCODE Catalog**, it’s best to:

1. Navigate to the catalog and locate the item.
2. Use the **"Discuss This"** option.

This will either direct you to an existing thread or automatically create a new, pre-tagged topic in Discourse. This ensures discussions are directly connected to catalog resources.

## Starting a New Topic
When no relevant discussion exists, create a new topic. Follow these steps:

1. **Choose the appropriate category** for your post by reviewing category descriptions.
2. **Provide enough context and details** to make your post useful to others.
3. **Add relevant tags** to improve discoverability.

> **Important:** Always adhere to the [**Code of Conduct**](./page-4.md). Maintain professionalism, contribute constructively, and stay on-topic.

By following these guidelines, you help keep the forum organized, useful, and welcoming for all users.


# Using Discourse Chat to Communicate Directly

Discourse includes a **chat feature** that allows you to connect directly with other registered users. Access the chat feature by clicking on the **chat bubble** next to the home menu button. This is ideal for:
![onebox-paste-link](./jointheconversation/chat.png)

- One-on-one conversations.
- Smaller group discussions that don’t require a public post.

## How to Use Discourse Chat:
1. Use the **search function** in the chat interface to find a specific user by name.
2. Start a chat directly from their profile or through the chat feature.

### Example Use Case:
You find an interesting item in the EarthCODE catalog and want to ask the researcher who published it some questions. If they are registered on Discourse, you can search for them by name and send them a direct message.
