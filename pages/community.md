## ESA Science Clusters
ESA Science Clusters are collaborative initiatives designed with a purpose to strengthen and advance scientific research across key Earth system science domains such as atmosphere, carbon cycle, hydrology, agriculture, cryosphere, oceans, geohazards. Each cluster is formed by ESA-funded projects and activities, experts, providing domain specific data and tools to promote cross -institutional collaboration, networking and knowledge exchange and joint effort to address common scientific challenges.

## ESA Science Hub
The Earth System Science Hub is an ESA facility designed to promote and support advanced Earth System and climate science studies. Science Hub is a centre of excellence for scientific collaboration and networking but also ideas exchange on the major science challenges of this decade. Science Hub activities are led by a dynamic and diverse group of international scientists, who bring their domain-specific expertise to closer look at some major challenges, underlying processes and drivers affecting our planet. All these activities are done in a cutting-edge, collaborative, cloud computing and open science environment to unlock the full potential of latest EO technologies.
